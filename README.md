# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
After completing our initial project to provide our PyBer boss, V. Isualize, with a plethora of different company analyses, Omar and I were given a new project to look specifically at total weekly fares paid by city type (Urban, Suburan, and Rural) to figure out what areas we receive the most revenue from on a monthly basis.
